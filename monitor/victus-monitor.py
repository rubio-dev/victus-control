"""Victus Control temperature monitor.

Runs as a per-user systemd service inside the desktop session and watches the
backend's temperature / fan / mode state over the control socket. Fires desktop
notifications when the machine is hot but cooling is not engaged, or when a
temperature is critically high.

It intentionally lives in the user session (not the privileged backend):
- notify-send needs the session D-Bus, which the user already has.
- The backend only samples temperatures while Better Auto is running, so it
  cannot observe the "hot while in MANUAL mode" case this monitor is meant to
  catch. Polling here covers every fan mode.

No root, no sudo, no desktop-specific assumptions beyond a running notification
daemon (KDE, GNOME, etc. all provide one).
